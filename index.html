        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science/Administrative Studiesüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a Political Science/Administrative Studies student at the University of California, Riverside. I have no previous experience at an official workplace because I am focusing mainly on school. I want to get my bachelors degree and apply to a Law School. I plan to become a lawyer and perhaps start some sort of a business. Until then I plan to put all my time in doing well at school so I can get into a good Law school. Although I have not worked in a workplace, I do have a lot of experience in many different areas. While I was in high school I was in the International Baccalaureate program (from which I graduated with an additional IB Diploma as well as a regular high school diploma). The program really helped me prepare not only for college but for the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù. By this I mean the idea of balancing your work and personal life, managing your time wisely due to all the work you receive, as well as being able to work well with others and on your own when needed.  <br><br>

        Also when I was in high school I was in my Theater Department, and while in the department I was able to take a lot of the experience to further help me in life. I helped put on many after school productions at my school, for this I would usually be at school for an average of 12 hours a day (including my before and after school activities). While in theater, I was casted a few times in some minor roles and I would also apply to manage some of the backstage technical departments. For the backstage work, I managed the publicity department and was in charge of publicizing the show. I learned how to deal with some interview situations and take some interviews for other students to join my crew. I also learned how to use many different online tools like Word, Canva, and Powerpoint. I also had to deal with customers on the days of the show as well as handling money for the shows. <br><br>

        I am now currently working on two different personal projects of mine. One of them is writing my own poetry book and getting it published. I have enjoyed writing poetry and just writing in general for a very long time, and I decided to take some time this year into working on finally creating and publishing one. The second project I have been working on this year is to start a mini etsy store in which I sell beanies. I used to make beanies and donate them to local shelters, and I plan to continue to do so, but I also wanted to start this small business to earn some money for school and perhaps donate to some non profit organizations. Both of these projects are currently under work, but I plan to complete them, or get them started this year by around summer time or at the end of this year.
